### Description
Makes the show less button for subscriptions/playlists and video descriptions on YouTube sticky.
### Notes
You can also easily change the background color to make it properly match whatever other themes you may have installed. If you only want one of these features but not the other, they can be toggled. You may need to go into the options to disable and then re-enable them if they aren't working, but should work fine after that.
